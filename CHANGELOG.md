# 3.0.0

- [BREAKING] The Slack does not allow Incoming Webhook to be used in more than 1 channel. So, all multiple-channel feature present and `username`/`user` parameters in gem was erased. Be careful that Slack Incoming Webhook not works anymore with multiple channels at once. Each webhook is now related to only one channel.

# 2.0.0

[BREAKING] This is a fairly large change to how defaults are set and how messages are processed.

**Setting Defaults**

Setter methods are no longer available for setting defaults on a notifier instance, you'll now set defaults with a block on initialization.

```ruby
# previously in 1.x
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new WEBHOOK_URL, http_client: CustomClient
notifier.channel = "sup"

# in 2.x
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new WEBHOOK_URL do
  http_client CustomClient
  defaults channel: "sup"
end
```

Read more about [setting defaults in the readme](readme.md#setting-defaults)

**Message Processing**

Message are now processed through a configurable middleware stack. By default it acts exactly the same as the 1.x versions. [More information is available in the readme](readme.md#middleware)

# 1.5.1
- allow using a single attachment w/o putting it in an array [@Elektron1c97  #47]

# 1.5.0
- allow sending with attachments only [#48]

# 1.4.0
- Format attachment messages with the LinkFormatter  [@bhuga #37]
- Add support for mailto links in markdown formatted links [@keithpitty #43]

# 1.3.1
- Fix bug with link formatter for markdown links wrapped in square braces [@bhuga #36]

# 1.3.0
- Add `#escape` to allow clients to escape special characters [@monkbroc #35]

# 1.2.1
- use `#scrub` to (more selectively) strip invalid characters from strings before attempting to format. This allows valid japanese (and more) characters to be used. Thanks to @fukayatsu for reporting.

  This checks for the presence of the `scrub` method on string, so if on ruby < 2.1 you'll need to include & require the `string-scrub` gem to handle invalid characters.

# 1.2.0
- Strip invalid UTF-8 characters from message before attempting to format links. They are replaced with the unicode replacement character '[ï¿½](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character)'. [@ushu #26]

# 1.1.0
- add ability to pass `:http_options` to the initializer or `#ping`. this allows you to set options like `read_timeout` or `open_timeout`. See [issue #17](https://github.com/stevenosloan/slack-notifier/issues/17) for more information.
