## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "slack-notifier"
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
gem install slack-notifier
```

## Usage

### Configuration of Incoming Webhook in Slack

The first step before using this gem is to configure the Incoming Webhook in Slack.

For this purpose, please check the official documentation of Slack. It's listed below some useful links:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJuntZSJVA
- https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
- https://slack.com/intl/en-br/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack
- https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks

After the configuration, keep your generated Incoming Webhook URL in a secret and secure way.

You will use it (the URL) in next sections of README.

### Hello World example

Once your webhook is setup, the example below will send the message "Hello World" to the channel you have associated with Webhook.

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
Slack::Notifier.new("WEBHOOK_URL").ping("Hello World")
```

### Gem public interface

The `Slack::Notifier` class has 3 main methods:

- `new`: Initialization of notifier
- `ping`: Simple invocation of Incoming Webhook API, passing a text message and additional parameters
- `post`: Advanced invocation of Incoming Webhook API, passing the available accepted parameters

### Default options

The default options can be defined in three ways:

- In Initialization, using a block

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  defaults my_key: "value", another_key: "another_value"
end

notifier.ping "Hello"
```

- In initialization, using a hash parameter

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL", my_key: "value", another_key: "another_value"
```

- In method invocations that sends the message (`ping` and `post`), using a hash parameter

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"
notifier.ping "Hello random", my_key: "value", another_key: "another_value"
```

The list of complete available default options, please check the official Slack documentation. Any key defined in `defaults` will be forwarded to Slack webhook endpoint.

### Links

Slack requires links to be formatted a certain way. Because of this, the gem has a default middleware that will look through your message and attempt to convert any html/markdown links to Slack's format before posting.

The example code below expose what it's doing under the covers:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
message = "Hello world, [check](http://example.com) it <a href='http://example.com'>out</a>"
Slack::Notifier::Util::LinkFormatter.format(message)
# => "Hello world, <http://example.com|check> it <http://example.com|out>"
```

### Formatting

Slack supports multiple formatting options.

If you want, for example, to alert the entire associated channel you can include `<!channel^CHANNEL_ID>` in your message:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"
notifier.ping "<!channel^CHANNEL_ID> hey check this out!"
# => It will send message "@channel hey check this out!" in your Slack channel
```

You can see more formatting examples (just like `<!here>`, `<!everyone>`, `<@USER_ID>` and others) in [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting).

### Escaping

Since sequences starting with < have special meaning in Slack, you should use `Slack::Notifier::Util::Escape.html` if your messages may contain literals `&`, `<` or `>`.

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
link_text = Slack::Notifier::Util::Escape.html("User <user@example.com>")
message = "Write to [#{link_text}](mailto:user@example.com)"
notifier.ping message
```

### Blocks

This plugin supports the [Slack blocks format](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/) and [block kit builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/). This is useful for displaying buttons, dropdowns, and images.

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"

blocks = [
  {
    "type": "image",
    "title": { "type": "plain_text", "text": "image1", "emoji": true },
    "image_url": "https://api.slack.com/img/blocks/bkb_template_images/onboardingComplex.jpg",
    "alt_text": "image1"
  },

  {
    "type": "section",
    "text": { "type": "mrkdwn", "text": "Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm TaskBot.\nThere are two ways to quickly create tasks:" }
  }
]

notifier.post(blocks: blocks)
```

### Reply in thread

To reply a thread in the channel associated with the Incoming Webhook, you need the message ID.

From Slack UI, if you right click the dots  and select "Copy link", you can extract the message ID (aka `ts`) and use it as a `thread_ts` parameter in notifier object:

![Screenshot 2020-03-09 at 10 46 57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7388889/76201322-5e952000-61f3-11ea-9e47-4e7f80b22d2b.png)

Important note: In order to work correctly, you **must** only use the message that **started** the thread, and not any reply sent in this thread.

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"

                             # "https://myworkspace.slack.com/archives/[Channel ID]/p[Message TS without dot]"
slack_thread_full_url        = "https://myworkspace.slack.com/archives/DD3F2GGG4/p1583742420167800"
thread_ts_extracted_from_url = slack_thread_full_url[/[^\/p]*$/].insert(-7, '.')

notifier.ping("Reply in thread", thread_ts: thread_ts_extracted_from_url)
```

### Additional parameters

Any key passed to the `post` method is forwarded to the webhook endpoint. Check out the [Slack webhook documentation](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) for the available parameters.

Below are exposed example codes using a subset of the available additional parameters that can be sent for Slack webhook endpoint:

Emoji icon / URL icon

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"

notifier.post text: "feeling spooky", icon_emoji: ":ghost:"
# or
notifier.post text: "feeling chimpy", icon_url: "http://static.mailchimp.com/web/favicon.png"
```

Attachments

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"

a_ok_note = {
  fallback: "Everything looks peachy",
  text: "Everything looks peachy",
  color: "good"
}

notifier.post text: "with an attachment", attachments: [a_ok_note]
```

### HTTP options

With the default HTTP client, you can send along options to customize its behavior as `:http_options` params when you post or initialize the notifier.

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL", http_options: { open_timeout: 5 }
notifier.post text: "hello", http_options: { open_timeout: 10 }
```

**Note**: you should only send along options that [`Net::HTTP`](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html) has as setters, otherwise the option will be ignored and show a warning.

### Proxies

`:http_options` can be used if you need to connect to Slack via an HTTP proxy.
For example, to connect through a local squid proxy the following options would be used.

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL", http_options: {
                                                              proxy_address:  'localhost',
                                                              proxy_port:     3128,
                                                              proxy_from_env: false
                                                            }
```

### Custom HTTP Client

There is a packaged default client wrapping Net::HTTP in gem. But there is scenarios where your HTTP needs might be a little different. In that cases, you can pass to notifier your own wrapper to handle sending the notifications. It just needs to respond to `::post` with the arguments of the endpoint URI, and the payload [pretty much the same as Net:HTTP.post_form](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html#method-c-post_form):

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

module MyOwnHTTPClient
  def self.post uri, params={}
    Net::HTTP.post_form uri, params
  end
end

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  http_client MyOwnHTTPClient
end
```

The customization of HTTP Client is useful especially for mocking purposes, logging, request tracking and so on. But pay attention to keep the expected API desired by gem.

You can also set the `http_client` per-post, if you need the customization only for certain pings/posts:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"
notifier.post text: "hello", http_client: MyOwnHTTPClient
notifier.post text: "bye" # => uses the default HTTP client
```

You also may want to watch the behavior of the notifier without posting to slack. This can be handled with a no-op client:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

class NoOpHTTPClient
  def self.post uri, params={}
    # You can log or observe posted params here
  end
end

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  http_client NoOpHTTPClient
end
```

### Middleware

By default, `slack-notifier` ships with a default middleware to format links in the message and in text field of attachments.

You can configure which middleware the notifier will use:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  middleware format_message: { formats: [:html] }
end
# => This example will *only* use the format_message middleware and only format :html links

notifier.post text: "Hello <a href='http://example.com'>world</a>! [visit this](http://example.com)"
# => It will post "Hello <http://example.com|world>! [visit this](http://example.com)"
```

The middleware can be set with a their name, or by name and options. They will be triggered in order that them are declared:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  middleware :format_message, :format_attachments
end
# => will run format_message then format_attachments with default options

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  middleware format_message:     { formats: [:html]     },
             format_attachments: { formats: [:markdown] }
end
# => will run format_message with formats [:html] then format_attachments with formats [:markdown]
```

The available middlewares are:

- **`format_message`**: This middleware takes the `:text` key of the payload and runs it through the [`Linkformatter`](#links). You can configure which link formats to look for with a `:formats` option. You can set `[:html]` (only html links), `[:markdown]` (only markdown links) or `[:html, :markdown]` (the default, will format both).

- **`format_attachments`**: This middleware takes the `:text` key of any attachment and runs it through the [`Linkformatter`](#links). You can configure which link formats to look for with a `:formats` option. You can set `[:html]` (only html links), `[:markdown]` (only markdown links) or `[:html, :markdown]` (the default, will format both).

- **`at`**: This simplifies the process of notifying users and rooms to messages. By adding an `:at` key to the payload w/ an array of symbols the appropriately formatted commands will be prepended to the message. It will accept a single name, or an array.

For example:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"
notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL"
notifier.post text: "hello", at: :casper
# => "<@casper> hello"

notifier.post text: "hello", at: [:here, :waldo]
# => "<!here> <@waldo> hello"
```

To send a message directly to a user, their username [no longer works](https://github.com/slack-notifier/slack-notifier/issues/51#issuecomment-414138622). Instead you'll need to get the user's ID and set that as the channel.

One way to get a Slack user ID is:

- Go to their Slack profile
- Click **...** ("More actions")
- Click **Copy Member ID**

### Writing your own Middleware

Middleware is fairly straightforward, it is any class that inherits from `Slack::Notifier::PayloadMiddleware::Base` and responds to `#call`. It will always be given the payload as a hash and should return the modified payload as a hash.

For example, lets say we want to replace words in every message, we could write a middleware like this:

```ruby
require "slack-notifier"

class SwapWords < Slack::Notifier::PayloadMiddleware::Base
  middleware_name :swap_words # this is the key we use when setting
                              # the middleware stack for a notifier

  options pairs: ["hipchat" => "slack"] # the options takes a hash that will
                                        # serve as the default if not given any
                                        # when initialized

  def call payload={}
    return payload unless payload[:text] # noope if there is no message to work on

    # not efficient, but it's an example :)
    options[:pairs].each do |from, to|
      payload[:text] = payload[:text].gsub from, to
    end

    payload # always return the payload from your middleware
  end
end


notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  middleware :swap_words # setting our stack w/ just defaults
end
notifier.ping "hipchat is awesome!"
# => pings slack with "slack is awesome!"

notifier = Slack::Notifier.new "WEBHOOK_URL" do
  # here we set new options for the middleware
  middleware swap_words: { pairs: ["hipchat" => "slack",
                                   "awesome" => "really awesome"]}
end

notifier.ping "hipchat is awesome!"
# => pings slack with "slack is really awesome!"
```
